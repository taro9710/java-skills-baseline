### 1.Introduction
What is GIT?

GIT is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for
coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code
software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for
distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on
different systems).
